OData Server
===========

This is a rails plugin/engine to embue your application with OData features (so its data can be readily consumed by 
an OData client).

It was forked Mark Borkum's work at from http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=9605 with only a few small additions
to support postgresql and declarative authorization and released as a gem.



The software iterates over your models exposing each as an OData source automatically.

Beware - this code is not heavily tested, it does work in my limited tests usint Tableau public to consume data.
