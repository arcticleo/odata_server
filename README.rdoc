=== OData Server

This is a rails plugin/engine to embue your application with OData features (so its data can be readily 
consumed by an OData client).

The software iterates over your models exposing each as an OData source automatically.

This code is not heavily tested.

See https://github.com/lmcalpin/odata_provider_example_rb for an example application that
uses this gem.
